# Grocery Store Application

This is a Django-based web application for a grocery store that manages customers and staff operations, including login, product management, shopping baskets, and purchase history. The application provides different functionalities for staff and customers, and the admin can manage the platform using the Django Admin panel.

## Features

### 1. **Authentication System**
- **Customers and staff login**: login pages for customers and staff. Users (staff and customers) can change their passwords.
- **Admin login**: Admin can log in and manage the system using Django's built-in admin panel.


### 2. **Product Management (For Staff)**
- Staff can **add** new products, **update** existing products, or **delete** products.
- Product information includes:
  - Product ID (automatically generated)
  - Product name
  - Price

### 3. **Basket Management**
- **Customers**: 
  - Can add products to their basket.
  - Can view the status of their basket (approved, denied, pending).
  - Can see their purchase history.
- **Staff**: 
  - Can view all customer baskets.
  - Can approve or deny a customer's basket.
  - Can query customer information and view their purchase history.

```
Follow the prompts to create the admin account.

### 5. Run the Development Server

### 6. Access the Admin Panel

The Django admin panel can be accessed at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` using the credentials of the superuser created earlier.

## Application Overview

### Models

- **Product**: Stores the details of the products (ID, name, price).
